Predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant

### BACKGROUND:
All of our bodies are composed of cells. The human body has about 100 trillion cells within it. And usually those cells behave in a certain way. However, occasionally, one of these 100 trillion cells, behave in a different way and keeps dividing and pushes the other cells around it out of the way. That cell stops observing the rules of the tissue within which it is located and begins to move out of its normal position and starts invading into the tissues around it and sometimes entering the bloodstream and becoming is called a metastasis.

In summary, as we grow older,throughout a lifetime, we go through this knid of situation where a particular kind of gene is mutated where the protein that it makes is abnormal and drives the cell to behave in a different way that we call cancer.

This is what Dr. WIlliam H. Wolberg was observing and put together this dataset.

### DATA SET INFORMATION:
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at [Web Link]

Separating plane described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, "Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming." Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree. Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes.

The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
